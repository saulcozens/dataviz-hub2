<h1 className="text-3xl mt-10 mb-5">Introduction</h1>
This is a template for blog posts. This website is built from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> framework and the way of styling is different from in HTML/CSS. 
You can write the post use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown</a> or/and HTML/CSS (preferable, because some syntax of markdown doesn't work, for example ##heading ). 
A copy of this blog file is available <a href="./index.mdx">here</a>.


<h1 className="text-3xl mt-16 mb-5">Setup</h1>


If you want to preview the post you've written, then you'll need to setup a gatsby development environment in order to preview the website.

  1. For Windows users, Download and install the latest Node.js version from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the official Node.js website</a>. 
  For other OS visit <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system">here</a>. 
  
  2. Install <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git</a>. 
  
  3. Install Gatsby CLI by running   `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

  4. Open up your terminal (and navigate to a directory you want to place the site) and run `gatsby new dataviz-hub https://github.com/researchdata-sheffield/dataviz-hub2` then run `cd dataviz-hub` and `npm install` (install dependencies), then `gatsby develop`.
Now you can view the site at `http://localhost:8000/`. Any changes you made to posts locally will be updated instantly on preview.



<h1 className="text-3xl mt-16 mb-5">Write a post</h1>

To contribute, raise an issue on GitHub or make a pull request that adds or modifies files in the `/content/blog/` directory. 
You will probably want to install Gatsby so that you can test your contribution before submitting it. 

1. Make a new directory under the `/content/blog/` directory, give a name (e.g. a keyword relevant to your post).

2. Create a file `index.mdx` (or with .md extension, but we recommend use .mdx because it’s a superset of Markdown syntax that also supports importing, exporting, and JSX. <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">learn more about mdx</a>). Then add content to the file.

3. Copy any other resources required for the post to the current directory. For example, if you want to include an image `post.jpg` then the file path for it would be `/content/blog/yourdirname/post.jpg`. Sections below will tell you how to embed images and videos.


## HEADING

<h1 className="mt-16 mb-5 text-3xl">Styling</h1>
<div className="leading-">
There are many ways to add styles to your md/mdx elements, in here we listed two methods to do this. 

1. Use the style attribute as usual with slightly different syntax:

```html
In HTML we normally style a div tag like this:
<div style="font-size: 25px, display: flex">
  Write something
</div>

-----------------------

In Gatsby we transform it into:
<div style={{font-size: "25px", display: "flex"}}>
  Write something
</div>
```


Make sure the target element are wrap within HTML Tags, e.g.  div, a, h1, and p.

</div>





<h1 className="text-3xl mt-16 mb-5">Image</h1>
This is how you would embed add an image (remember to add your images in the same directory of your md/mdx file):

```js
![my image description](./temp.jpg)
```

Alternatively: 

```js
<img alt="my image description" src="./temp.jpg" />
```




<h1 className="text-3xl mt-16 mb-5">Video</h1>
This is how you would embed a video:

```js
`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5yRLFcbv4s`
```
Note: you can't styling videos at the moment.
`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5yRLFcbv4s`
