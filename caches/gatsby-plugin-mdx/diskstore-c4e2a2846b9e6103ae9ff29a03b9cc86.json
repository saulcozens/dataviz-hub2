When sound enters the ear canal it produces vibrations, which initiate the conversion of sound waves into an electrical current. These currents are sent to the brain via special sensory nerve fibres and allow us to perceive sound.`}</p>\n      <p>{`In normal hearing, central efferent nerve fibres send instructions to hair cells and afferent auditory fibres to change how they are functioning – for example, when a noise is very loud they will reduce the activity of the hair cells to avoid damage. This efferent feedback system helps to keep the hair cells and sensory nerve fibres healthy. However, in age-related hearing loss there is a change in the connection between the efferent nerve fibres and the hair cells which we are yet to understand.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Professor Walter Marcotti explains, “Our research will investigate the change in the efferent nerve fibres in the aging cochlea to test whether this happens as an attempt to repair the faulty aged cochlea. This work will be performed in collaboration with Dr Mirna Mustapha and Dr Stuart Johnson from the Hearing Research Group alongside Dr Saaid Safieddine from the Institute Pasteur in Paris and Professor Dwayne Simmons from the Baylor College in Texas.`}</p>\n      <p>{`“We will not only investigate when, how and why these changes in the efferent nerve fibres occur, but also provide evidence about their functional role and whether the faulty cochlea has the potential to revert back to its normal mature structure following repair. As we begin to think about therapeutic strategies to combat age-related hearing loss, should we be trying to prevent, or promote, the efferent re-wiring?`}</p>\n      <p>{`“This has the potential to provide a significant breakthrough in our quest to deliver a treatment for the millions of older adults affected by age-related hearing loss.”`}</p>\n      <p>{`The research forms part of the work of the University of Sheffield’s Neuroscience Institute, which aims to bring academics and scientists together from across varied specialties to translate scientific discoveries from the lab into pioneering treatments that will benefit patients living with neurodegenerative and sensory disorders.`}</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
