<h1 className="mart">Introduction</h1>
This is a template for blog posts. This website is built from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> framework and the way of styling is different from in HTML/CSS. 
You can write the post use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown</a> or/and HTML/CSS (preferable, because some syntax of markdown doesn't work, for example space ). 
A copy of this blog file is available <a href="./index.mdx">here</a>.

<h1 className="mt-24">Setup</h1>

If you want to preview the post you've written, then you'll need to setup a gatsby development environment in order to preview the website.

  1. For Windows users, Download and install the latest Node.js version from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the official Node.js website</a>. 
  For other OS visit <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system">here</a>. (You might also need to download Visual Studio installer to install node.js development tools).
  
  2. Install <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git</a>. 
  
  3. Install Gatsby CLI by running   `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

  4. Open up your Git Bash (and navigate to a directory you want to place the site) and run `git clone https://github.com/researchdata-sheffield/dataviz-hub2.git dataviz-hub` then run `cd dataviz-hub` and `npm install` (install dependencies), then `gatsby develop`.
Now you can view the site at `http://localhost:8000/`. Any changes you made to posts locally will be updated instantly on preview. Press `Ctrl + C` if you want to stop it running locally.

<b>NOTE:</b> At step 4, if you have <b>Github Desktop</b> installed then just clone the repository into your computer and under the repository you would need to use Git Bash to run `npm install` etc.

# Write a post

To contribute, raise an issue on GitHub or make a pull request that adds or modifies files in the `/content/blog/` directory. 
You will probably want to install Gatsby so that you can test your contribution before submitting it. 

1. Make a new directory under the `/content/blog/` directory, give a name (e.g. a keyword relevant to your post).

2. Create a file `index.mdx` (or with .md extension, but we recommend use .mdx because it’s a superset of Markdown syntax that also supports importing, exporting, and JSX. <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">learn more about mdx</a>). Then add content to the file.

3. Copy any other resources required for the post to the current directory. For example, if you want to include an image `post.jpg` then the file path for it would be `/content/blog/yourdirname/post.jpg`. Sections below will tell you how to embed images and videos.

# Styling
<div>
There are many ways to add styles to your md/mdx elements, in here we listed two methods to do this. 

1. Use the style attribute as usual with slightly different syntax:

```html
In HTML we normally style a div tag like this:
<div style="font-size: 25px, display: flex">
  Write something
</div>

-----------------------
In Gatsby we transform it into:
<div style={{fontSize: "25px", display: "flex"}}>
  Write something
</div>

For any declaration in HTML with hyphen, 
in Gatsby we remove the hyphen and capitalise the letter after the hyphen.
```

2. This website has integrated <b>tailwindcss</b> framework therefore you can style elements by applying <b>pre-existing classes</b> directly in your HTML. 
Explore [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width) to see available classes you can utilise.

```html
// In Gatsby, class is replaced by className
An example of using tailwindCSS

<p className="text-3xl text-gray-500 mb-24">TAILwindCSS</p>

text-3xl: text size with 3xl.
text-gray-500: text color set to be gray with transparency of 500 (50% probably).
mb-24: bottom margin with size 24. 
```
Output:
<p className="text-3xl text-gray-500 mb-24">TAILwindCSS</p>

</div>

Of course you can also add your own class, just need to make sure all classes you've created need to be place in the file `dataviz-hub/src/css/post.css`. Specificity is important, 
to avoid your classes being override by other styling plugins, add `body` before each class. Alternatively, use style attribute. 

<br />
<br />

# Code

To add inline code, surround your code by single backtick. 
```
`inline code`
```

For a code block, use triple backticks.

```
1```
code block
1```

1 is for illustration, remove it in practice.
```




<h1 className="text-3xl mt-24 mb-5">Image</h1>
This is how you would embed add an image (remember to add your images in the same directory of your md/mdx file):

```js
![my image description](./temp.jpg)
```

Alternatively: 

```js
<img alt="my image description" src="./temp.jpg" />
```



<h1 className="text-3xl mt-24 mb-5">Video</h1>
This is how you would embed a video:

```js
`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5yRLFcbv4s`
```
Note: you can't styling videos at the moment.
`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5yRLFcbv4s`
for more informtion about embedding videos, visit  <a style={{color: "blue"}} href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-embed-video/#usage">here</a>.
