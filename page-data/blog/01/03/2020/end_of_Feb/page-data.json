Since its establishment, the NBA has been recording data on players' scores, assists and \\x1Celd goal percentage (NBA, 2019). With the development of technology and people's attention to data, more and more indicators have been added to the database and used to establish di\\x1Berent evaluation systems. For example, (Miko\\xAAajec, Maszczyk, and Zaj\\xA1c, 2013) found that the data obtained by doctors from smart wearable devices cannot only help maintain the health of the players, but also help the players to better prevent injuries and better from injuries by using more detailed data and combining the medical equipment owned by the team, and recover faster. On the other hand, coaches can develop tactics based on ofensive and defensive data on the \\x1Celd, use video and data as an improvement guide for action, and chose to sign the right player (Miko\\xAAajec et al., 2013). In addition, the player's data in the game is used to make technical statistics. But the most popular system is the scores and rankings of the players and teams participating in the competition. \", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), \"Today, the NBA uses a variety of awards to recognising players' abilities, such as the MVP in the regular and All-Star games, the Rookie of the Year, the best defensive player, and the fastest-growing player (NBA, 2019). In an NBA game, each indicator of on-site technical statistics (such as points scored by the player, number of three-pointers, and number of individual steals) re\\x1Dects the player's ability in one aspect. We cannot distinguish the player's three-pointer ability and free throw ability from the player's score, nor can we simply determine the player's o\\x1Bensive ability from the assist data. A single indicator has its irreplaceable role, but its limitations determine that it cannot make an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the comprehensive ability of basketball players. Therefore, this dissertation will select appropriate summaries and use Latent variable model and an optimisation function algorithm to calculate the player's overall ability after each game, and then develop a adjustable workflow from reading and processing, modelling to the \\x1Cnal display of results.\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Chapter 1 - Dynamic Factor Models: Inferring abilities for NBA players","author":["Y.L Weng"],"date":"Sunday 1st March 2020","category":["Articles"],"tag":["Statistics","Dataviz"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"221a26ca-3bea-5ec4-af37-e71f7b325c0d","slug":"/blog/01/03/2020/end_of_Feb","prev":{"node":{"id":"9e48e6c9-6e60-54d8-9e69-76f1aa08af53","fields":{"slug":"/blog/01/03/2020/award"},"frontmatter":{"template":null,"author":["Y.L Weng"],"title":"Award-winning Sheffield neuroscientists honoured at Buckingham Palace reception","date":"Sunday 1st March 2020","category":["News"],"tag":["Award"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/dataviz-hub2/static/f87efab2a042d1a312b4e66ce9471f96/9e240/award.jpg"}}}}}},"next":{"node":{"id":"c4759653-b01f-5cd1-94ba-eb9500d0121a","fields":{"slug":"/blog/01/03/2020/hearing"},"frontmatter":{"template":null,"author":["Y.L Weng"],"title":"Scientists awarded funding to investigate causes of age-related hearing loss","date":"Sunday 1st March 2020","category":["News"],"tag":["Science","Neuroscience"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/dataviz-hub2/static/a5f24356802da739ca3b96f45667c2e6/9e240/hear.jpg"}}}}}}}}}
