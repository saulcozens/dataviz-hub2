It is a progressive disorder, which affects our ability to discriminate speech in a noisy environment and is associated with social isolation, depression, and an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Although hearing aids and cochlear implants are beneficial, they cannot restore normal hearing. This is especially the case when the cells in the ear are missing or do not function, which are both characteristic features when hearing loss is age-related.  A major obstacle preventing the development of new treatments is a lack of understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause the progressive loss of hearing with age. Uncovering these mechanisms will pave the way to develop new approaches to prevent, slowdown or even reverse the loss of this important sensory system.","date":"Sun, 01 March 2020","author":["Y.L Weng"],"category":["News"],"tag":["Science","Neuroscience"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/dataviz-hub2/static/a5f24356802da739ca3b96f45667c2e6/9e240/hear.jpg"}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"categories":["Articles","Events","News","Student"],"tag":"Neuroscience","tags":["Award","Blog","Dataviz","Neuroscience","ORDA","Science","Staff","Statistics","Test","The University of Sheffield"],"limit":9,"skip":0,"currentPage":1,"numPages":1}}}
